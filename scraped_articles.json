It had been written by author Ken Jennings, known in the US for winning the classic TV game show Jeopardy! 74 times in a row - and pocketing more than $2.5m (\u00a31.85m) in the process.\n\nSegarra, who tweets using the Twitter handle @annieelainey - adapted Jennings' tweet so it read \"#HotPersonInAWheelchair\", adding: \"Cry about it, babe\". She attached a photo to the tweet showed her in a chic outfit.\n\nImage copyright Annie Segarra/Twitter\n\nMore than 2,700 people liked the post from Segarra - who was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) in 2014 and is now a wheelchair user.\n\nIt prompted some of her followers who are also wheelchair users to post photos of themselves with the same hashtag.\n\nAustralian para-athlete Robyn Lambird (@Robyn_lambird) shared this image of herself wearing a white hoodie.\n\nImage copyright Robyn Lambird\n\nAnd this came from Elsie, wearing a pink leather jacket (@65PinkRoses).\n\nImage copyright @65PinkRoses/Twitter\n\nListen to this week's Ouch podcast\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\n\nThe team discuss the recent death of actor Verne Troyer and whether the character he was best known for - Mini-Me in the Austin Powers films - has normalised violent attacks against others with dwarfism.\n\nSegarra addressed the issue further on Facebook.\n\n\"We're here, we're hot, we deserve to feel hot, to be seen, to take up space,\" she posted.\n\n\"We deserve to use the mobility aids and any other device or assistance we need without shame.\n\n\"I think what's important here is that tweets stand the test of time. They still have the power to hurt and offend or anger years after posting when their author totally forgot what they'd originally said.\"\n\nMeanwhile images using Segarra's hashtag kept coming. Diogo Martins (@rodas89) tweeted a picture of himself and his partner, both in wheelchairs.\n\n\"A hot woman in a wheelchair is in a relationship with a guy (who she states is hot too) in a wheelchair!\" he wrote in the caption.\n\nImage copyright Diogo Martins/Twitter\n\nAnd Caitlin Goerlich (\u200f@CGoerlich) commented to Ken Jennings, the original tweeter, \"Hey @KenJennings - I think you are very, very wrong.\"\n\nShe then posted photos of herself in prom dresses, casually at home and practising archery.\n\nImage copyright Caitlin Goerlich/Twitter\n\nBack in 2014 - when the original tweet was posted - California-based stand-up comic Billy Anderson (@BillyAndersonYo) tried to lighten the mood. He tweeted a posed-by-model image of a man in a wheelchair sweltering in a sunny garden.\n\n\"When @KenJennings tweeted 'Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair' pretty sure he meant it THIS way. #SoSad\"\n\nKen Jennings hasn't responded directly to the most recent criticism to date."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-44007382", "published": "2018-05-06T23:10:48", "title": "Marylove Edwards: The 13-year-old 'Nigerian Serena'", "text": "I'm back and ready - Serena Williams\n\nAs she prepares to return to the WTA Tour, Serena Williams says she is \"ready to play\" even if it is at a \"turtle's pace\"."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43761093", "published": "2018-05-06T23:37:09", "title": "Can you make a community healthier?", "text": "Video\n\nLife expectancy in Fleetwood, Lancashire, is among the worst in the UK, with diseases linked to diet and drugs claiming lives.\n\nThe Healthier Fleetwood programme is planning to change all that."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44008153", "published": "2018-05-06T23:50:17", "title": "Could Trump's 'Space Force' become a reality?", "text": "Could Trump's 'Space Force' become a reality?\n\n\"We're getting very big in space,\" says the US president.
